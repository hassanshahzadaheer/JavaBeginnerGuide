##### Q1 : What is bytecode and why is it important to Java’s use for Internet programming ?
###### Answer
```
Bytecode is a highly optimized set of instructions designed to be executed by the Java run-time system,
which is called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) . In essence, the original JVM was designed
as an interpreter for bytecode.Translating a Java program into bytecode makes it much easier to run a program in

platform.
